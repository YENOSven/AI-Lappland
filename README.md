#IMPORTANT
Make sure you have voicevox downloaded and application running or the program wont be able to find it(annoying but im not sure how to change that).
Make sure you have Llama 3.2-1b or any other Llama language model downloaded.



Also the code isn't entirely mine

output_with_tone is the file you will be using to train llama 3.2-1b i used 1b for simplicity and i dont have high specs required.


#INSTRUCTIONS
1.download nessesary libaries
2.download Llama 3.2-1b or other
3.download a translator to translate (link: https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-jap) since voicevox is more accurate with japanese characters, or you could just comment voicevox out and use EDGE tts instead.
